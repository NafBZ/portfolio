        A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniquesâ€”the A and the B.
        Typically, the A is an existing technique, and the B is a new technique.
        A/B testing not only determines which technique performs better but also
        whether the difference is statistically significant. A/B testing usually
        compares a single metric on two techniques; for example, how does model
        accuracy compare for two techniques? However, A/B testing can also compare
        any finite number of metrics.
